You are correct. When using SQLite, the `php artisan migrate` command will automatically create the database file if it doesn't already exist.

Here is the updated `README.md` with only the SQLite option.

# Simple Note-Taking API

A simple RESTful API for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting notes. This project was built with Laravel to demonstrate basic API development, including CRUD operations, data validation, and handling single and multiple resource requests.

## Features

  * **GET /api/notes:** Retrieve all notes.
  * **POST /api/notes:** Create a new note. Supports both single and batch creation.
  * **PUT /api/notes/{id}:** Update an existing note.
  * **DELETE /api/notes/{id}:** Delete a note.
  * **Notes with title, body, and tags:** Each note includes a title, a body, and an array of tags for categorization.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

  * **PHP:** Version 8.1 or higher
  * **Composer:** For managing project dependencies
  * **SQLite:** For the database

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/note-taking-api.git
    cd note-taking-api
    ```

2.  **Install Composer dependencies:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Configure the environment file:**
    Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  **Set up the database for SQLite:**
    Set the database connection in your `.env` file to point to a local SQLite file.

    ```ini
    DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
    ```

    You do not need to manually create the file; it will be created automatically during migration.

5.  **Generate the application key:**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6.  **Run database migrations:**
    This will create the `notes` table and the `database.sqlite` file in your `database` directory.

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

7.  **Start the local development server:**

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

Your API is now running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## API Endpoints

You can use a tool like **Postman** to test the endpoints. All endpoints should be prefixed with `/api/`.

### Get All Notes

`GET /api/notes`

### Create a New Note

`POST /api/notes`

  * **Single Note:** Send a JSON object.
    ```json
    {
      "title": "My First Note",
      "body": "This is a test note.",
      "tags": ["personal", "work"]
    }
    ```
  * **Multiple Notes (Batch Creation):** Send a JSON array of objects.
    ```json
    [
      {
        "title": "Note 1",
        "body": "This is note one.",
        "tags": ["ideas"]
      },
      {
        "title": "Note 2",
        "body": "This is note two.",
        "tags": ["shopping"]
      }
    ]
    ```

### Update a Note

`PUT /api/notes/{id}`

  * **Example:** `PUT /api/notes/1`
    ```json
    {
      "title": "Updated Title",
      "body": "The body has been changed.",
      "tags": ["important"]
    }
    ```

### Delete a Note

`DELETE /api/notes/{id}`

  * **Example:** `DELETE /api/notes/1`
